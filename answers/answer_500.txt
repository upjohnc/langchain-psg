Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that provides a transactional and versioned log-structured merge-tree (LSM) storage system for big data. It allows you to work with large-scale datasets in a way that's similar to working with small-scale datasets, using tools like pandas or Polars.

In simpler terms, Delta Lake is a type of database that enables you to manage and analyze large amounts of data efficiently and securely. It provides a scalable and reliable way to store and process big data, making it suitable for use cases such as data warehousing, data science, and business intelligence.
