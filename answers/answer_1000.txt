Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that provides a scalable and reliable way to store and manage large-scale datasets. It builds on top of Apache Hadoop's HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) and allows you to treat your data as if it were a relational database, while still being able to take advantage of the scalability and fault-tolerance of HDFS.

Delta Lake provides features such as:

* Versioning: allows for multiple versions of a table to be stored, making it easier to track changes and maintain a history of updates.
* Transactions: enables atomic operations on data, ensuring that either all or none of the operations are committed.
* Schema enforcement: checks the schema of incoming data against the expected schema, preventing errors due to incorrect data types or missing columns.

By using Delta Lake, you can simplify your data processing workflows, improve data quality, and increase your team's productivity.
