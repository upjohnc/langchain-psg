Deltalake is a library that allows you to read and write Delta Lake tables directly from your Python or Rust code, without requiring Spark. It provides a simple and efficient way to interact with Delta Lake data on your local machine.

With deltalake, you can use popular libraries like pandas to query and manipulate Delta Lake tables, without having to launch a Spark cluster or deal with the complexities of distributed computing. This makes it easy for developers of all levels to work with Delta Lake data in their favorite programming language!
